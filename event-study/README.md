This study is based on "Building Nations through Shared Experiences: Evidence from African Football" research by Emilio Depetris-Chauvin, Ruben Durante, and Filipe Campante.

The objective is to use event study to examine whether shared collective experiences help build a national identity, by looking at the impact of national football teamsâ€™ victories in sub-Saharan Africa.
