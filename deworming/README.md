This study is based on Edward Miguel and Michael Kremer's research titled "Worms: Identifying Impacts on Education and Health In the Presence of Treatment Externalities". The objective is to evaluate a Kenyan project in which school-based mass treatment with deworming drugs was randomly phased into schools, rather than to individuals, allowing estimation of overall program effects.
