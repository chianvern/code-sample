This folder contains a curated selection of code samples of economic analyses I have conducted as part of my graduate coursework. These samples showcase a range of advanced econometric methods and data analysis techniques, highlighting my proficiency in both theoretical and applied economics.

#### Data Visualization
- Utilized various visualization tools to create insightful and compelling graphical representations of complex datasets.
- Techniques include time-series plots, scatter plots, histograms, and heat maps to uncover trends, correlations, and anomalies.

#### Regression Analysis
- Implemented multiple linear and nonlinear regression models to explore relationships between dependent and independent variables.
- Addressed potential issues such as multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, and autocorrelation, ensuring robust and reliable results.

#### Instrumental Variable (IV) Analysis
- Applied IV techniques to address endogeneity concerns, using appropriate instruments to obtain consistent and unbiased estimators.
- Conducted rigorous testing for instrument validity, including relevance and exogeneity tests.

#### Regression Discontinuity (RD) Study
- Leveraged RD designs to identify causal effects at threshold points, providing clear insights into the impact of specific interventions or policies.
- Ensured the credibility of RD results through thorough checks for manipulation around the cutoff and balance tests for covariates.

#### Event Study
- Conducted event studies to analyze the impact of significant events on economic variables, particularly in financial markets.
- Used methodologies to measure abnormal returns and assess the significance of event impacts over different time windows.

#### Data Preparation
- Executed comprehensive data cleaning processes, including handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
- Employed data transformation and feature engineering techniques to enhance the quality and predictive power of the models.
