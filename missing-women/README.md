This study is based on Nancy Qian's paper "Missing Women And The Price of Tea in China: The Effect of Sex-Specific Earnings on Sex Imbalance".

The objective of this study is to use exogenous increases in sex-specific agricultural income caused by post-Mao reforms in China to estimate the effects of total income and sex-specific income on sex-differential survival of children.
